# Alpha Gamma Delta - Zeta Eta Chapter Prototype
This is a website I created to protoype my sorority's (Alpha Gamma Delta) website while serving as Vice President of Campus Relations for Fall 2023, I came up with the idea for the website after being inspired by other AGD chapters and with the goal of showcasing our chapter to other Alpha Gam chapters and people looking to join in the Spring of 2024. Some websites that helped with the inspiration are: https://www.uaalphagam.com/ and  https://ugaalphagam.com/

All images were found on google, custom designed images (mainly found on the philanthropy section) were created by myself on Canva.
